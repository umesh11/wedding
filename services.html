							<span>Wedding Ring</span>
							<p>In Western countries, wedding rings are often made of rose, white or yellow gold, platinum, palladium or, more recently, silicone. The perpetuity of noble metals is thought to symbolize the steadfastness of the marriage bond. Common engravings on the inside of the ring include the name of one's spouse, or of both spouses, and/or date of the wedding, and possibly a phrase of special meaning. In many countries the engagement rings are plain while the bride's engagement ring typically has jewels.,,</p>

								<li><p><a href="#">we Guarantee you for Happy Marriages</a>Matchmakers trade on the belief that romantic love is something akin to a human right, and the modern online dating service is just one of many examples of a dating system where technology is invoked almost as a magic charm with the capacity to bring happiness.

								<li><p><a href="#">Caste Marriages</a>Marriage can be recognized by a state, an organization, a religious authority, a tribal group, a local community or peers. It is often viewed as a contract. Civil marriage, which does not exist in some countries, is marriage without religious content carried out by a government institution in accordance with the marriage laws of the jurisdiction, and recognised as creating the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony. Marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting via a wedding ceremony.</p></li>

								<li><p><a href="#">polygamy</a>Polygamy is a marriage which includes more than two partners.When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship is called polygyny, and there is no marriage bond between the wives; and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry, and there is no marriage bond between the husbands. If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives, it can be called group marriage.</p></li>

								<li><p><a href="#">polygyny</a>Although a society may be classified as polygynous, not all marriages in it necessarily are; monogamous marriages may in fact predominate. It is to this flexibility that Anthropologist Robin Fox attributes its success as a social support system: "This has often meant – given the imbalance in the sex ratios, the higher male infant mortality, the shorter life span of males, the loss of males in wartime, etc. – that often women were left without financial support from husbands. To correct this condition, females had to be killed at birth, remain single, become prostitutes, or be siphoned off into celibate religious orders. Polygynous systems have the advantage that they can promise, as did the Mormons, a home and family for every woman</p></li>
