							<span>Wedding Ring</span>
							<p>In Western countries, wedding rings are often made of rose, white or yellow gold, platinum, palladium or, more recently, silicone. The perpetuity of noble metals is thought to symbolize the steadfastness of the marriage bond. Common engravings on the inside of the ring include the name of one's spouse, or of both spouses, and/or date of the wedding, and possibly a phrase of special meaning. In many countries the engagement rings are plain while the bride's engagement ring typically has jewels.,</p>

					   <p>Marriage is the process by which two people make their relationship public, official, and permanent. It is the joining of two people in a bond that putatively lasts until death.Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws, as well as society in general. The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal.</p>
